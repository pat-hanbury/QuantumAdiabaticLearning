Monday monrning 

Purpose: 8 Particle ground state calculation using adiabatic method 



increased total monte carlo simulations per delta from 200 to 400 

hoping to ensure that converges occurs at each delta 

10,000 MC steps 

UPDATE: a and b parameters are fixed 

intermediate parameter plots are outputted 



for plots: Green dot indicates start. Red dot indicates end
